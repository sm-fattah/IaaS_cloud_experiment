# IaaS_cloud_experiment

The experiment creates an environment where several users performing free trials on a set of IaaS cloud provider
to decide which provider is the most appropiate for their workloads. A long-term IaaS cloud selection frame work is built which helps a new 
consumer to perform short-term trial to decide which provider is the most appropiate for their long-term workload. 

The experiment is built using Matlab. The runAll.m file will run the simulate and generate all graphs.
